imagine your boss come in and says," give me the latest numbers!"
    You have no idea what he is referring to
        sales?
        production?
        clients?
        growth?
    
    The trouble is you have no context to understand what your boss needs  from you

    Comoputers are the same. the data is meaningless with a structure to interpret the meaning of whatever youre asking of them
