has been around since 2006
mainly introduced to combat issues with vertical and horizontal scalibility

    Netconf really breaks things down into 2 different tasks
        operational / state
            statistics

        config

        set configuration

How netconf PROTOCAL works:
    port 830
    leverages ssh 
    ONLY AND ALWAYS USES XML payloads
        messages : <rps> , <rpc-reply>
        operations : <get> (perational states), <get-config> (gets raw configuration), <edit-cinfig> (sets raw config), etc. 
        content: <data>

        <rpc id = 1234>
